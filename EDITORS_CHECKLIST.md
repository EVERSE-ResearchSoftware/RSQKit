- The new page is linked in the appropriate sidebar menu, if needed.
- The Contributors' names are listed in the [CONTRIBUTORS file](_data/CONTRIBUTORS.yaml) and each page they contributed to.
- All relevant metadata fields in a specific page are correctly filled in.
- Make sure that relevant tools, resources, training and related pages are tagged in the text of the updated pages.
- The Contributors implemented the requested changes and comments, if needed.
- The Contributors are acknowledged and thanked for their efforts and informed about the publication of their content.
- The PR is linked to related issues and can be merged into the main branch with no conflicts.
