[European Life Science Research Infrastructures (LS-RI)](https://lifescience-ri.eu/home.html) such as [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) are serving excellent life sciences research in Europe by providing needed access to world-class facilities, samples, instruments, services, and data.
The European LS-RIs were established to overcome a technology gap and to allow access to much-needed technologies in modern research approaches.
They have the mission to support cutting-edge science by offering access to the latest technologies, comprehensive resource collections and technical expertise.
An example is the [ELIXIR STEERS](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/steers) project, which aims to provide software and workflows to life scientists, maximising productivity in research, and minimising consequent energy usage.

## Services

### Training catalogue The [TeSS Life Sciences Training Catalogue](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/) is a platform that was developed to provide a one-stop shop for trainers and trainees to discover online information and content, including training materials, events and interactive tutorials. While its scope is wider than research software, training materials on the best practices mentioned in the RSQKit may also be found.
