title: Research Clusters & Infrastructures
---

This section lists research clusters and research infrastructures where software is a core part of activities.

[Research Infrastructure(RI)](https://www.esfri.eu/research-infrastructure-ri) are facilities, resources and services that are used by the research communities to conduct research and foster innovation in their fields. 

They include: 
- Major scientific equipment (or sets of instruments)
- Knowledge-based resources such as collections
- Archives and scientific data
- einfrastructures, such as data and computing systems and communication networks and any other tools that are essential to achieve excellence in research and innovation

Research Clusters (e.g. [Science Clusters](https://science-clusters.eu/)) are a network of research infrastructures in a given domain (e.g. astronomy, life sciences, environmentl sciences) that work together to harmonise services, share data and support open science. They provide a structured way to coordinate infrastructures, avoid duplication and for example, create common standards for data, workflows, and training.
