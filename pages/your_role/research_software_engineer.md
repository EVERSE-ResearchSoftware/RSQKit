## Introduction

A Research Software Engineer (RSE) plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between research and software development. 
Their tasks and responsibilities can vary significantly depending on the research domain, but they generally focus on ensuring that software used in research is robust, reusable, and efficient.


## Responsibilities, tasks & challenges

The main responsibilities and common challenges of the RSE role in relation to reseach software development and Research Software Quality include:

- Collaboration with researchers: translate research problems into technical requirements and help implement solutions
- Software development: write and maintain code for research projects (prototyping, optimization, refactoring)
- Code quality and best practices: apply best practices like version control, testing, documentation, and continuous integration
- Reproducibility & sustainability: ensure research outputs are reproducible and software is maintainable
- Training: educate researchers and early career RSEs on coding practices and tools
- Data management: handle data wrangling, storage, format conversions, and pipeline automation
- Performance optimization: improve performance of simulations, analyses, or computational workflows
- Tool integration: help integrate existing tools and frameworks into research environments

### Domain-specific tasks

Soma example domain specific tasks of RSEs are listed below.

Life & health sciences:

- process and analyse genomic or proteomic data
- develop tools for sequence alignment, gene expression analysis, or CRISPR design
- optimize bioinformatics pipelines using tools like Snakemake or Nextflow
- build machine learning pipelines for medical imaging or patient data
- support integration with electronic health record systems

Physics & astronomy:

- implement or optimise simulations (e.g., quantum mechanics)
- parallelize code for HPC (using MPI/OpenMP)
- analyse big data
- visualise simulation results

Social sciences & digital humanities:

- build web applications for interactive data visualisations
- process and analyse textual or multimedia data using NLP techniques
- design databases for archival and metadata handling

Environmental science:

- develop and maintain climate models or Earth system models
- automate data assimilation pipelines
- visualise geospatial data using GIS tools
