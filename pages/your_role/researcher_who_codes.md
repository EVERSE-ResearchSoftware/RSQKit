Researchers who code are academics or research domain experts who write software or scripts as part of their research workflow. 
Their primary focus is the research, not the software â€” but coding is often essential for data analysis, simulations, modeling, or automation.
You may come from disciplines like physics, life sciences, environmental sciences or the humanities, and your coding skills are often self-taught and were developed organically out of necessity rather than formal training.

When compared to the role of an [Research Software Engineer](research_software_engineer) (whose primary goal is to build sustainable, reliable, and reusable software to support research across different domains), your primary goal is to 
conduct novel research and use code to solve domain-specific problems and you focus on scientific questions, experimentation, and data interpretation.
