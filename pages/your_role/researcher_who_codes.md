title: Researcher Who Codes

Researchers who code are academics or research domain experts who write software or scripts as part of their research workflow. 
Your primary focus is the research, not the software â€” but coding is often essential for data analysis, simulations, modeling, or automation.
You may come from disciplines like physics, life sciences, environmental sciences or the humanities, and your coding skills are often self-taught and developed organically out of necessity rather than formal training.

When compared to the role of an [Research Software Engineer](research_software_engineer) (whose primary goal is to build sustainable, reliable, and reusable software to support research often in different domains), your primary goal is to 
conduct novel research and use code to solve domain-specific problems and you focus on scientific questions, experimentation, and data interpretation.

### Software responsibilities, challenges & tasks

In your role of researcher who codes, you may do similar or the same tasks as an RSE. There is a slight disctinction.

- May have basic to intermediate programming knowledge; often self-taught
- write code for short-term use (e.g., analysis scripts, simulations, prototype code) within a single project
- work independently or with small teams, focusing on specific hypotheses or experiments
- use or build on top of existing tools and scripts to test hypotheses or analyse data
- test your code to make sure it performs as expected
- make your research-specific code more reproducible and suitable for reuse by others - Code is often research-specific and not intended for reuse

RSE:

- Deep knowledge of software development practices (e.g., testing, CI/CD, versioning)	
- Writes modular, maintainable, and reusable code, often across multiple projects or domains
- works alongside researchers to translate scientific problems into robust software	Often works independently or with small teams, focusing on specific hypotheses or experiments
- builds workflows, automation pipelines, and scalable systems
- Prioritizes thorough documentation and automated testing
- Aims for general-purpose tools or platforms usable by others	Code is often research-specific and not intended for reuse


ðŸ§ª Research-Driven Coding
They write code to test hypotheses, analyze data, or run simulations â€” not necessarily to build reusable tools or general-purpose software.

ðŸ’¡ Self-Taught or Informally Trained
Many learn coding through online tutorials, peer collaboration, or trial and error, often without formal computer science education.

ðŸ“‚ Code is Often Project-Specific
Their code is usually designed to support one research project or paper, and may not be intended for reuse by others.

ðŸ§° Uses Tools of Convenience
Languages and platforms like Python, R, MATLAB, or Jupyter notebooks are popular, often selected based on community norms in their field.

ðŸ“ˆ Prioritizes Results Over Engineering
The emphasis is on getting results that support research goals â€” things like software architecture, documentation, or testing may be secondary.

ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration with RSEs
When projects grow more complex, researchers who code often benefit from working with Research Software Engineers (RSEs) to improve code quality, scalability, and reusability.
