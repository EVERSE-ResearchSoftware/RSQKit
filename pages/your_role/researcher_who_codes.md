title: Researcher Who Codes

Researchers who code are academics or research domain experts who write software or scripts as part of their research workflow. 
Your primary focus is research, not the software — but coding is often essential for data analysis, simulations, modeling or automation.
You may come from disciplines like physics, life sciences, environmental sciences or humanities, and your coding skills are often self-taught and developed organically out of necessity rather than formal training.

When compared to the role of an [Research Software Engineer](./research_software_engineer) - whose primary goal is to build sustainable, reliable, 
and reusable software to support research often in different domains) - your primary goal is to 
conduct novel research and use code to solve domain-specific problems and you focus on scientific questions, experimentation, and data interpretation.

| Has deeper knowledge of software development practices (e.g., testing, CI/CD, versioning)   | Has basic to intermediate programming knowledge; often self-taught                                                         |
| Writes modular, maintainable, and reusable code, often across multiple projects or domains  | Writes code for short-term use (e.g., analysis scripts, simulations, prototype code) within a single project               |
| Works alongside researchers to translate scientific problems into robust software           | Works independently or with small teams, focusing on specific hypotheses or experiments                                    |
| Builds workflows, automation pipelines, and scalable systems                                | Builds own scripts or uses existing tools and scripts to test hypotheses or analyse data                                   |
| Aims for general-purpose tools or platforms usable by others                                | Writes code that is usually designed to support one research project or paper, and may not be intended for reuse by others |
| Employs software engineering practices - software architecture, documentation and testing   | Prioritises results over engineering - the emphasis is on getting results that support research goals                      |

Although researchers who code and Research Software Engineers (RSEs) have different primary focuses and responsibilities, there is significant overlap in the tasks they perform and the software quality practices they should follow.

## Software responsibilities, challenges & tasks

These are the key software-related things you are typically responsible for:

- Developing research-driven code to implement analyses, simulations, or models
- Processing and visualising data using scripting languages like Python, R, or MATLAB
- Managing research data — reading, transforming, cleaning, and storing data for analysis
- Organising project files and scripts in a way that supports reproducibility (to varying degrees)
- Documenting code (even minimally) to recall how it works or explain it in papers
- Validating results via debugging or comparing outcomes across test cases
- When projects grow more complex, researchers who code often benefit from working with [RSEs](./research_software_engineer) to improve code quality, scalability, and reusability.

## Software quality guidance

- [Organising software projects](./organising_software_projects) - a well-structured project directory facilitates collaboration, maintenance, and reproducibility
- [Adopting FAIR principles](./fair_rs) promotes transparency and facilitates wider adoption of research software
- Code quality best practices - [version control](./using_version_control), [testing](./testing_software), [documentation](./documenting_software) and [licencing](./licensing_software)
- [Software testing practices](./testing_software) and automating tests using [Continuous Integration](./ci_cd) (CI)
- Engaging in [code reviews](./code_review) - regular code reviews contribute to code quality and facilitate knowledge sharing among team members
