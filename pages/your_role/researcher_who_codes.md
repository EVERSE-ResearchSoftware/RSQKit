title: Researcher Who Codes

Researchers who code are academics or research domain experts who write software or scripts as part of their research workflow. 
Your primary focus is the research, not the software â€” but coding is often essential for data analysis, simulations, modeling, or automation.
You may come from disciplines like physics, life sciences, environmental sciences or the humanities, and your coding skills are often self-taught and developed organically out of necessity rather than formal training.

When compared to the role of an [Research Software Engineer](research_software_engineer) (whose primary goal is to build sustainable, reliable, and reusable software to support research often in different domains), your primary goal is to 
conduct novel research and use code to solve domain-specific problems and you focus on scientific questions, experimentation, and data interpretation.


In your role of researcher who codes, you may need to:

- write code for short-term use (e.g., analysis scripts, simulations, prototype code) within a single project
- work independently or with small teams, focusing on specific hypotheses or experiments
- use or build on top of existing tools and scripts to test hypotheses or analyse data
- document and test your code
- make your research-specific code more reproducible and suitable for reuse by others
