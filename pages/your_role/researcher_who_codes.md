## Introduction

While the term [Research Software Engineer](https://everse.software/RSQKit/research_software_engineer) (RSE) is more or less established in many countries, not everyone working with research software identifies with this term easily. 
Many researchers, postdocs, students rather prefer to stay in their role of being (or becoming) a physicist, a biologist, an engineering (of different kind), a social scientist, and so on. 
This large group of people may or may not fall under the role of an RSE, but they all could profit from research software engineering techniques and tools. 
Topics like how to publish software, how to pick a license, how to write tests, and more are crucial when writing research software, no matter how the persons identify themselves.
Thus, the role of a Researchers who codes (RWC) is coined to cover also this group, finding them where they are and not imposing a new role on them.

## Key responsibilities

Researchers who code (RWCs) are writing or maintaining research software, often on a daily basis. 
The research software they are working with is the basis for their and their co-workers' scientific progress, leading to new results, papers, collaborations, contributions to meetings, and so on. 
Coming from their own domain (physics, social sciences, math, computer science), they all rely on their or others code to work properly and correctly.
Failures, such as a non-functional or even wrong code, will impact their progress, either due to additional time spent fixing the code or, in the worst case, tracking wrong results.

## Challenges and solutions

Writing good research software requires (1) awareness, (2) a certain skillset, (3) good tools, and (4) enough time to take care of this.
The work of EVERSE can support these aspects in a multiple manner:
* Awareness campaigns, especially targeting RWCs through their connections to the science clusters
* Providing resources for obtaining the required skillset
* Good tools or at least recommendations of those, where tools are possible and helpful

When targeting not only RWCs but also their team leaders, decision makers and further stakeholders, the last point (4) might also be improved upon through EVERSE.
