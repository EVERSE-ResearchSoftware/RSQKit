The Research Software Quality Toolkit (RSQKit) is a resource to help researchers that code, Research Software Engineers, and anyone in between learn about and apply best practices in creating research software and code.

It is developed by the European Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence (EVERSE) project funded by the European Union through the HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02 call.
