The Research Software Quality Toolkit (RSQKit) is a resource to help researchers that code, Research Software Engineers, and anyone in between learn about and apply good practices in developing, collaborating on and improving the quality of research software.

RSQKit is developed by the European Virtual Institute for [Research Software Excellence (EVERSE) project](https://everse.software/).
