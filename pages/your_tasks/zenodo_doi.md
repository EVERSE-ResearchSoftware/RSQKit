## What is a Digital Object Identifier?

A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a [persistent identifier][what-are-pids] or a handle used to uniquely identify 
various objects, such as journal articles, research reports, dataset or software, standardised by the International 
Organization for Standardisation (ISO).

A DOI fits within the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) system, and also resolves to its target - the information 
object to which the DOI refers. 
This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL where the object is located. 

Obtaining a DOI for software has become [increasingly popular][datacite-doi-software] to indicate to others how to
cite your software (either in a publication or as an independent way of referring to your software).

There are many services that can "mint" DOIs, i.e. perform the process of creating and assigning a DOI to an object.
We will explore how you can do that for your software using {% tool "zenodo" %}, a general-purpose open archive and 
publishing repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN.

Zenodo's DOI versioning feature allows users to create a **concept DOI** (which represents the software package as a 
whole, including all its versions) and multiple **release DOIs** for software packages (with each DOI representing a 
specific version of the software package).
In other words, the concept DOI is a reference to a software project as a whole, while the software version DOI is a 
reference to a particular software release.

## Why is it important?

Publishing your code to Zenodo is a valuable practice that enhances the visibility, citability, and long-term preservation of your research software. By linking your code repository to Zenodo, you can:

1. Obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for your software, making it easier to cite and track.
2. Ensure long-term preservation of your code, even if the original repository becomes unavailable.
3. Increase the discoverability of your software through Zenodo's search functionality and metadata.
4. Comply with funding agency requirements for open science and data sharing.
5. Provide a stable, versioned archive of your software for reproducibility purposes.

In this document, we describe how to automatically archive a snapshot of your code repository on Zenodo whenever you create a new release of your software. 


## How can I get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for code hosted on GitHub using Zenodo?

Here we describe how to obtain a DOI for your software hosted on {% tool "github" %} using Zenodo.

### Considerations

* While this is not mandatory, using {% tool "github" %} as your software repository can help with issuing DOIs for your software due to its integration with {% tool "zenodo" %}.
* You want to publish a software release of your code (e.g. using [semantic versioning][semantic-versioning]).
* You need an account on {% tool "zenodo" %} and you can create it using your {% tool "github" %} account (effectively linking the two). 
If you already have a {% tool "zenodo" %} account that is not linked to your {% tool "github" %} account - you can always link them from {% tool "zenodo" %} later.

### Solutions

* If you do not have a Zenodo account - create a Zenodo account now preferably with your GitHub account.
* If you already have a Zenodo account, link your GitHub account to Zenodo as follows:
	* Go to Zenodo website.
	* Navigate to your [Zenodo profile page](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/profile).
	* Select the `GitHub` tab, then click on `Connect`.
	* Authorise Zenodo to access your GitHub account
	* Choose which repository you would like to create a DOI for under the repositories sections
		* You may need to scroll down to find the repository if you have access to many repositories
* From Github, [create a release](./releasing_software) for the software repository you have enabled: 
	* Go to your repository software repository on GitHub.
	* Click on `Releases` and then `Draft a new release` button.
	* Remember to use a version number ([semantic versioning][semantic-versioning] is commonly used  but there are other schemes such as [CalVer][calver] which is date based)
* Zenodo will automatically archive this release due to its integration with GitHub:
	* Once your GitHub repository is linked to Zenodo, any new release you publish on GitHub will be archived by Zenodo.
	* Zenodo will automatically issue a DOI for each new release.
* Get the DOI:
	* After making the release in GitHub, go back to the [GitHub option on Zenodo for your account][your-zenodo-github] where you will see 
  your repository archived with a DOI assigned to it. If you click on it - you will be taken to the Zenodo record for 
  your software. You can see the Zenodo DOI badge under `Details`:

![Badge in Zenodo](../../images/badge_zenodo.png)

* Copy the badge to the README file in your software repository in GitHub:
	* Click on the blue DOI badge - a window will pop up with badge in various formats. 
    * Copy the Markdown version to your README. It will show in GitHub as follows:

![Badge in GitHub repository](../../images/badge_in_repo.png)

## How can I get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for code hosted on GitLab using Zenodo?

Here we describe how to obtain a DOI for your software hosted on {% tool "gitlab" %} using Zenodo.


### Considerations

* You use a {% tool "gitlab" %} instance (either on gitlab.com or self-hosted) as your software repository
* You make software releases (e.g. using [semantic versioning][semantic-versioning])
* You use or are happy to make an account on {% tool "zenodo" %}
* You would like to archive your code on {% tool "zenodo" %} and obtain a DOI for each software release that people can use to cite your work
* You can provide metadata for your software in a `.zenodo.json` file or a `codemeta.json` file in the root of your repository to specify the metadata for your Zenodo deposit.
* Your {% tool "gitlab" %} repository can run CI/CD pipelines.

### Solutions

* Provide software metadata in a `codemeta.json` file at the root of your repository. See [codemeta](./software_metadata) for more information.
  
* Get a [Zenodo token](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new/) with publishing rights (`deposit:actions` and `deposit:write` scopes).

* Add the {% tool "eossr" %} or the [gitlab2zenodo](https://gitlab.com/sbeniamine/gitlab2zenodo) libraries in  your [GitLab-CI pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/) to automatically archive your code on Zenodo whenever you create a new release.
  * Note that if using gitlab2zenodo, you will need to convert your `codemeta.json` file to a `.zenodo.json` file, e.g. using the eossr.

* [Create a GitLab release](./releasing_software) in your repository.
  * Go to your repository
  * Click on releases and then on New release
  * Use the same version number as specified in your metadata (e.g. `1.0.0`).
  * Add release notes
  * Click on Create release

* The CI pipeline will automatically push your code on Zenodo.

* Get the DOI:
   * After the GitLab release, go to Zenodo, where you will see your repository archived with a DOI assigned to it. Your badge is available in "Details":

![Badge in Zenodo](../../images/badge_zenodo.png)

* You may copy the badge in your README file:
   * Now you can add the Zenodo badge in your GitLab repository. Click on the blue DOI and copy the markdown in your README. It will show as follows:

![Badge in your repository](../../images/badge_in_repo.png)
