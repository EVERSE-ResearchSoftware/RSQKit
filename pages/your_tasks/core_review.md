Code Review in Research Software Development
What is Code Review?

Code review is the process of systematically examining someone else’s code (or your own, after some time) to find bugs, improve quality, and ensure adherence to coding standards. It’s a collaborative practice aimed at improving software reliability, readability, and maintainability.
Why It Matters in Research

In research settings, where software often evolves rapidly and is reused over long periods, code review helps:

    Catch errors early before they affect research outcomes.

    Promote reproducibility by ensuring clarity and documentation.

    Encourage best practices like modular design and testing.

    Facilitate collaboration, especially in multi-disciplinary teams.

    Support onboarding of new team members with shared knowledge.

What to Look For in a Review

    ✅ Correctness – Does the code do what it’s supposed to?

    🧹 Style and Consistency – Are naming conventions, formatting, and structure consistent?

    🧪 Testing – Are there tests? Do they cover expected use cases and edge cases?

    🧾 Documentation – Are functions, classes, and scripts clearly documented?

    🧱 Modularity – Is the code organized into reusable and testable components?

    🌀 Performance – Is the code efficient enough for the task?

Code Review Tips

    🔄 Use Pull Requests: In systems like GitHub or GitLab, use pull/merge requests to structure reviews.

    💬 Keep it Constructive: Offer clear, kind feedback. Ask questions rather than criticize.

    📏 Automate Where Possible: Use linters and formatters to catch simple issues before review.

    🧠 Focus on Learning: Code reviews are a two-way street—reviewers can learn as much as authors!

Tools That Help

    GitHub / GitLab – Built-in review tools for discussions and suggestions.

    Code linters (e.g., flake8, eslint) – Ensure code style consistency.

    CI pipelines – Automatically run tests and checks on submitted code.
