## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD is a continuous method of software development, where you continuously build, test, deploy, and monitor iterative code changes.

This iterative process helps reduce the chance that you develop new code based on buggy or failed previous versions. GitLab CI/CD can catch bugs early in the development cycle, and help ensure that the code deployed to production complies with your established code standards.

## What is Gitlab CI?

### Description

Gitlab CI is the tool used in Gitlab hosted projects (gitlab.com and self hosted Gitlab instances) to run CI/CD pipelines. It is the equivalent of Github Actions on github.com hosted repositories.

Motivations to setup a Gitlab CI pipeline:

- running unit tests
- build your application
- build a docker container
- deploy documentation
- deploy and generate package
- check dependencies
- ...

### Considerations

To create and run your first pipeline:

- ensure you have runners available to run your jobs. If tou are using gitlab.com, you can skip this step as gilab.com provides instance runners for you.
- create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of your repository. This file defines the pipelines and jobs you want to run.

You can find a lot of different examples of existing gitalb-ci files.
Make sure you extract what you need from these examples.
In the next part, we will describe a sample of the most common and useful stages.

### Solutions

You can follow Gitlab first tutorial [^gitlabci_first_tuto] and the more advanced one [^gitlabci_advanced_tuto]. Gitlab.com is also providing some typical examples based on your programmation language and type of project [^gitalbci_examples].

Example of `.gitlab-ci.yml`
```yml
stages:
    - build
    - deploy

build-job-name1:
    stage: build
    script:
        - echo "Starting job 1"

build-job-name2:
    stage: build
    script:
        - echo "Starting job 2"

deploy-job-name:
    stage: deploy
    script:
        - echo "Deploy"
```

This will create a pipeline with two stages `build` and `deploy`. The stage `build` is composed of two independant jobs that will be run in parallel if you have enough runners. The `deploy` stage will be run after `build` stage is finished.
