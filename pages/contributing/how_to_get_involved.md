title: How to get involved
---

The RSQKit is currently in a startup phase and still under heavy development which means its structure and content is likely to change a lot.
During this phase, we mainly organise contributions through the EVERSE project's internal documents and communication channels, 
although it is possible for people external to the project to contribute.
Contributions via [email][email] and [GitHub][rsqkit-github] are also possible.

### Roles 

There are various roles available, based on the level and type of the involvement with the project.

The content of RSQKit is currently being approved and curated by the [RSQKit Editorial Board](./editorial_board), 
who are also acting as the official **Maintainers** of the [RSQKit repository][rsqkit-github].
The **RSQKit Editorial Board Members** (aka **Editors**) work together with **Internal Contributors** from the EVERSE project and 
**External Contributors** (jointly known as **Contributors**) to identify where and how their contribution fits best in RSQKit.

### Documentation
