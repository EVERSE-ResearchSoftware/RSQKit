## How to Contribute to RSQKit

We provide detailed guidelines on how to contribute to RSQKit, what to contribute and what not to contribute in 
the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

That document also outlines [Contributor responsibilities](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-responsibilities) as well as how we [acknowledge Contributors](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#acknowledgement-of-contributions).

## Ownership of Content

No single Contributor or Editor owns the content of the site, or has the right to dictate what the content should be. 
The content on the RSQKit is a community effort, with many contributors. 
Initially, in the early stage of the RSQKit development, decisions will be driven by consensus among the Editors.

The content is periodically updated, which means that if you create content in an RSQKit page, others can change the content without notifying you. 
However, the RSQKit Editors will ensure that content is only modified for good reasons and the legitimate concerns and different 
point of views of all Contributors are accommodated, and that the content reflects the most popular consensus on any given topic.

If you find any content unsatisfactory, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/issues/new) about it.
