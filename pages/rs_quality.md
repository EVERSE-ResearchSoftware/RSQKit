title: Research Software Quality
---

This section is focused on the definition and assessment of research software quality, keeping in mind that quality 
standards vary depending on the software’s purpose. Metrics such as community involvement, code updates, and testing 
practices are useful indicators, but they only provide indirect insights into software quality, which is often subjective 
and context-dependent. Moreover, it should be further clarified that we recognise the challenge of balancing the 
software’s "fit for purpose" with broader goals like reusability and long-term sustainability, noting also the non-linear 
relationship between quality, impact, and the potential for unintended uses.

Beyond strict technical aspects of research software quality, this page will also address additional factors that 
influence research software excellence, such as assessing the software's FAIRness, the Open Source nature of projects 
and their sustainability.

## Quality Dimensions & Indicators

EVERSE project is working to formally define a number of [research software quality dimensions](https://everse.software/indicators/website/dimensions.html) 
along with a [formal schema](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/schemas/tree/main) to be used in machine readable metadata 
embedded in various resources.

Each of the quality dimensions will be an umbrella for a number of [quality indicators](https://everse.software/indicators/website/indicators.html), 
representing a specific software quality aspect that can be measured.

Current research software quality dimensions are described below. This is still work in progress - we expect indicators 
to change a bit in the near future.

### Compatibility

Degree to which a product, system or component can exchange information with other products, systems or components,
and/or perform its required functions while sharing the same common environment and resources.

### FAIRness

FAIRness refers to the degree to which research software adheres to the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
and Reusable. These principles, adapted for research software, aim to enhance the discoverability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reusability of software, thereby maximizing its value and impact in scientific research.

### Flexibility	

Degree to which a product can be adapted to changes in its requirements, contexts of use or system environment.

### Functional Suitability	

Represents the degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions.

### Interaction Capability	

Degree to which a product or system can be interacted with by specified users to exchange information via the user interface to complete specific tasks in a variety of contexts of use.

### Maintainability	

This characteristic represents the degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified to improve it, correct it or adapt it to changes in environment, and in requirements.

### Performance Efficiency	

This characteristic represents the degree to which a product performs its functions within specified time and throughput parameters and is efficient in the use of resources (such as CPU, memory, storage, network devices, energy, materials...) under specified conditions.

### Reliability	

Degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time.

### Safety	

This characteristic represents the degree to which a product under defined conditions to avoid a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is endangered.

### Security

Degree to which a product or system defends against attack patterns by malicious actors and protects information and data so that persons or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorisation.


### Sustainability

The capacity of the software to endure. In other words, sustainability means that the software will continue to be
available in the future, on new platforms, meeting new needs.
