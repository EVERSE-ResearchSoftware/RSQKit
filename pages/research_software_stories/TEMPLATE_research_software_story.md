## The Problem <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle for the description of the problem

Describe the problem(s) your software is trying to solve for your community.


## The Community <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about the community/communities that use or will potentially use this software

Describe the community that uses your software


- Describe how the development is organised (e.g. is it one person, many, how are they organised and/or governed)
- Who are the users - how experienced are they in using your software?

## Technical Aspects <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- What is the tier(s) of software involved (e.g. analysis code, prototype tools, research software infrastructure (including services))
- Technical specifications:
   - language(s)
   - any measures of the codebase (e.g. size, complexity, activity, how long it's been running)
   - deployment requirements (e.g. does it need a HPC infrastructure - what compute/data or contextual requirements does it require)

### Libraries and Systems <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- List any domain/community specific libraries and systems you make use of in your software solutions.

## Software Practices <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about which software practices are being used and their benefits to the user community

- What practices do you use to develop the software (e.g. version control, contribution policy, licensing, other practices)?
- What benefits have the developers gained in building their software by applying these software quality practices?

## Community <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about how the software is being adopted for usage and how a community is being built around it

- How do you onboard new developers?
- How do you onboard new users?
   - Explain your main user stories (the main types of users, what they want to achieve and what the benefit to them is) 

## Tools <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about the other tools that help in improving your research software  

- List any tools that you use to help you improve or assess the software quality of your code and a short description of how they help your software. Please refer to [_data/tool_and_resource_list.yml](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/_data/tool_and_resource_list.yml) file in the RSQKit repository and add any ones that are missing.
- What has been the benefit to the project of using these tools?

## FAIR & Open <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about how your research software is aligned with FAIR and/or Open practices

 - FAIR: see the [FAIR software page in RSQKit](https://everse.software/RSQKit/fair_rs) and [Five recommendations for FAIR software](https://fair-software.eu/) for inspiration - e.g. are there a repository and a license, do you have a community registry/catalogue where the code is available, is it citable, do you have a “good software” checklist?
 - Open: cover how you follow open source practices and open development practices?
 - What has been the benefit of following these open source and open development practices?

## Documentation <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about how documenting the research software helps the user community using the research software

 - How is the documentation for your software presented and maintained?

## Sustainability <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about how is the research software being made sustainable

- How is the software development lifecycle managed, e.g. are there any governance structures in place?
- How active is the project? 
- How is it funded?
- How is the software maintained during and beyond the end of funding?
