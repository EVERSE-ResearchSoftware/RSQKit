## The Problem
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle for the description of the problem

<!--

**What scientific or practical problem does the software solve?**

**Questions:**

- What was difficult, fragile, slow, or unreliable before this software existed?
- What scientific question or workflow needed improvement?
- Why was existing tooling not enough?
- What assumptions sit behind the problem?
- What boundaries or limitations define the scope?

*Write 2-3 full sentences first, then add bullets if helpful.*

## Technical Aspects

<!--

**What is the software, technically?**

**Questions:**

### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about which software practices are being used and their benefits to the user community

<!--

**What practices guide development and collaboration?**

**Questions:**

- How do you use version control?
- Is there code review? Testing? Release processes?
- How are decisions made?
- How do people communicate about changes?
- What's informal but still important?
- What have the benefits been of using these practices?

*First: 2-3 sentences capturing reality as it is.*

**Questions:**

- What linters, formatters, CI systems, test runners, or similar are used?
- How do you containerise or package the environment?
- What workflow or documentation tools help keep things stable?
- Which of these tools make daily development easier?

*Begin with sentences; bullets optional.*

Note: if any tools mentioned don’t exist in https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/_data/tool_and_resource_list.yml consider adding them

-->

## FAIR & Open
### Add a short one-two liner subtitle about how your research software is aligned with FAIR and/or Open practices

<!--

**How does your software align with FAIR principles and open practices?** *2-3 sentences*

**Questions:**

- Is the code publicly findable? How?
- What licence do you use?
- How can others access the software and its documentation?
