The [Photon and Neutron Open Science Cluster (PaNOSC)](https://www.panosc.eu/) is the Science Cluster representing Photon and Neutron European Research Infrastructures (RIs), developing and providing services for its scientific community and connecting these to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

## Objectives
- Participate in the construction of the EOSC by linking with the e-infrastructures and other science clusters.
- Make scientific data produced at Europe’s major Photon and Neutron sources fully compatible with the FAIR principles.
- Generalise the adoption of open science, standard metadata and data stewardship from all photon and neutron RIs and physics institutes across Europe
- Provide innovative data services to the users of these facilities locally and the scientific community at large via the EOSC.
- Increase the impact of RIs by ensuring data from user experiments can be used beyond the initial scope.
- Share the outcomes with the community at large to promote the adoption of FAIR data principles, data stewardship and the EOSC.

## Software-related Services Offered

### Software Catalogue

Access the [PaN software catalogue](https://software.pan-data.eu/) linked to the analysis and simulation software used in PaN facilities. Find documentation, links and complete examples of data sets and practical information about the scientific instruments used to collect them. 

### Training Catalogue

The [training catalogue](https://pan-training.eu/) provides a one-stop shop for trainers and trainees to discover online information and content, including training materials, events and interactive tutorials. The catalogue provides opportunities to promote training events and news, and to contribute to a growing catalogue of materials; for trainers, the portal offers an environment to allow the sharing of materials and event information; for trainees, it offers a convenient gateway via which to identify relevant training events, resources and to perform specific, guided analysis tasks via customised training workflows to provide FAIR research.

### Data Services

The PaN science cluster also offers access to a large number of [data services](https://www.panosc.eu/services/).
