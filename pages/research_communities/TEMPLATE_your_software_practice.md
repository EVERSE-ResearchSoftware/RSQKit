## The Problem <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

Describe the problem(s) your software is trying to solve for your community.


## The Community <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

Describe the community that uses your software (e.g. in your pilot, exemplar or however you wish to demark your community):

- Describe how the development is organised (e.g. is it one person, many, how are they organised and/or governed)
- Who are the users - how experienced are they in using your software?

## Technical Aspects <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- What is the tier(s) of software involved (e.g. Tier 1: analysis code; Tier 2: prototype tools; Tool 3: research software infrastructure (including services))
- Techical specifications:
   - language(s)
   - any measures of the codebase (e.g. size, complexity, activity, how long it's been running)
   - deployment requirements (e.g. does it need a HPC infrastructure - what compute/data or contextual requirements does it require)

## Software Practices <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- What practices do you use to develop the software (e.g. version control, contribution policy, licensing, other practices)?

## Onboarding <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- How do you onboard new developers?
- How do you onbaord new users?
   - Explain your main user stories (the main types of users, what they want to achieve and what the benefit to them is) 

## Tools <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- List any tools that you use to help you improve or assess the software quality of your code and a short description of how they help your software. Please refer to [_data/tool_and_resource_list.yml](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/_data/tool_and_resource_list.yml) file in the RSQKit repository and add any ones that are missing.

## Indicators <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- Which software [quality dimensions](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/_data/quality_dimensions.yml) and/or associated [software quality indicators](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/_data/quality_indicators.yml) do you feel that your software already achieves?
- Which software dimensions/indicators would you like to improve in your software?
- What indicators do your users really care about?

## FAIR & Open <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

 - FAIR: see [FAIR software RSQKit page](https://everse.software/RSQKit/fair_rs) and [Five recommendations for FAIR software](https://fair-software.eu/) for inspiration - e.g. are there a repository and a license, do you have a community registry/catalogue where the code is available, is it citeable, do you have a “good software” checklist?
 - Open: cover how you follow open source practices and open development practices?

## Documentation <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

 - How is the documentation for your software presented and maintained?

## Sustainability <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- How is the software development lifecycle managed, e.g. are there any governance structures in place?
- How active is the project? 
- How is it funded?
- How is the software maintained during and beyond the end of funding?

## Community or Domain Resources <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- Are there any guides, training or other resources that are referred to for developing software in your community?
- Are there any guides, training or other resources for using the software produced for your community?

## Recognition <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- How are developers and contributors to the software acknowledged and/or rewarded in your community (e.g. is there any recognition, does it help with careers)?

## Libraries and Systems <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- List any domain/community specific libraries and systems you make use of in your software solutions.
