# Introduction

This page contains set of criteria to help curators determine if something is "Research software quality tool".

This list is not intended to be exclusive, for instance “most tools that measure a software quality metric are software quality tools” but “not all software quality tools measure software quality metrics” but having a set of criteria would help to add tools in RSQkit tools and resources and TechRadar.


# Initial set of criteria:
· The tool allows the measurement of a software quality metric
· The tool helps automates testing or analysis of software
· The tool was designed to improve software quality
· The tool supports programming language/s or approaches used for research software
· (The tool is frequently used on research software) 
· Support for community standards and best practices relevant to specific research disciplines


# Page location - need to be discussed.
