# Introduction

This page contains set of criteria to help curators determine if something is "Research software quality tool".

This list is not intended to be exclusive, for instance “most tools that measure a software quality metric are software quality tools” but “not all software quality tools measure software quality metrics” but having a set of criteria would help to add tools in RSQKit tools and resources and TechRadar.


# Initial set of criteria:
· The tool is designed to measure and/or improve a software quality dimension
· The tool automates the measurement and/or improvement of software quality 
· The tool is frequently used on research software and being actively maintained
· The tool enables the software it is used on to follow relevant research community standards and best practices
