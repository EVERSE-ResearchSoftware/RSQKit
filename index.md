![EVERSE Banner](images/markus-spiske-Skf7HxARcoc-unsplash.jpg)

RSQKit is a service started by the [EVERSE](https://everse.software) project. 
It contains a collection of curated training resources, tools and guidelines on research software quality that align, adapt, and extend to the specific needs of various research communities. It also aims to establish a recognition framework that rewards scientists and trainers for their contributions to research software by providing recognition/credit attribution.
