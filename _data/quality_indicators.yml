    description: For analysis code specifically, is there a quantifiable measure of
        the functional correctness of the software output. This indicator focuses
        on computational/statistical correctness. For example, in an ML model software
        context, the indicator measures whether the repository reports metrics like
        Accuracy, F1-score, or ROC-AUC to prove the model performs as intended. However
        other performance metrics may also address the indicator. Evaluation metrics
        may be provided through documentation, tables or scripts available in the
        source code of the target tool.
