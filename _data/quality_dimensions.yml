-   abbreviation: open_source_software
    description: Open source software is software with source code that anyone can
        inspect, modify, and enhance. Research software can be published with or without
        open access to the source code. Open access to source code aligns better with
        academic research purposes than closed source software; open source software
        aligns with the FAIR4RS principles. It allows other researchers to directly
        verify the methods used to produce the results published in papers. It also
        makes reproducibility much easier. In addition to these research-driven reasons,
        publishing research software as open source software can help with long term
        maintenance in a cost-effective way, since interested developers can easily
        contribute new functionality or fix bugs. Moreover, by integrating with the
        greater open source ecosystem, researchers can leverage tools and support
        communities already available. As such, for most academic communities with
        limited resources, it is also a good choice from a software engineering perspective
