## Overview of compare_rsqkit_techradar_tools.py Script

The `compare_rsqkit_techradar_tools.py` script is designed to perform a detailed comparison of the tools listed in two repositories: the RSQkit tool list `(_data/tool_and_resource_list.yml)` and the software tools repository from TechRadar `(https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar/tree/main/data/software-tools)`. The script evaluates discrepancies between the descriptions of each tool in both sources and summarizes the results at the end of execution.

### Workflow:
- Input Sources:
RSQkit: The tools list is sourced from the file _data/tool_and_resource_list.yml.
TechRadar: The tools list is sourced from the TechRadar repository at https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar/tree/main/data/software-tools.

- Comparison Process:
The script iterates through both tool lists and compares the description fields of each tool.
Discrepancies between the descriptions are identified.

- Action Required:
Based on the comparison, the contributors will need to update the description field in the RSQkit tools list, ensuring that the description is more accurate and aligned with the correct information.

- Summary Report:
After execution, a summary of the discrepancies will be provided, highlighting the tools with description differences and suggesting which description (RSQkit or TechRadar) is more accurate.

### CI Integration:
This script is executed automatically on the CI pipeline under the job named `Run discrepancy check script`. This ensures that the comparison and discrepancy check are run regularly, maintaining consistency and accuracy without manual intervention.
