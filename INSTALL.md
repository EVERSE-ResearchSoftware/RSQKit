# Local Installation

**NOTE: it is not necessary to install and run RSQKit locally to make contributions to it - check our [**Contribution Guidelines**](https://everse.software/RSQKit/contribution_guidelines) for details.**

The [RSQKit website](https://everse.software/RSQKit/) is automatically built and deployed whenever changes are merged into the main branch of this repository.
For every pull request, a preview version of the resulting site will be generated by [Netlify](https://everse-rsqkit-testing.netlify.app/).
Therefore, it is generally not necessary to install the RSQKit locally and contributions can be made via GitHub interface too.

Nevertheless, if you do wish to run the RSQKit website locally for development and testing purposes, please follow the instructions below.

We provide instructions for installing RSQKit and all the software necessary to run it directly on you machine or within a Docker container.

## Installing RSQKit directly on your machine

**Prerequisites:** `ruby`, `bundler` and `jekyll`.

The RSQKit uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the website based on the files and information located in this repository.
Jekyll is a Ruby gem which can be installed on most systems.

To install Ruby, follow the [Ruby installation instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for your operating system.
You will also need [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) (a gem to manage other Ruby gems on your system) - but it is usually preinstalled with modern distributions of Ruby.

To install Jekyll, follow the [official installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

After successfully installing `ruby`, `bundler` and `jekyll`, clone the RSQKit repository on your machine (e.g. using SSH):

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit.git
```

Next, you will need to install the dependencies of the RSQKit itself:

``` bash
cd RSQKit
bundle install
```

You can build and run the RSQKit locally using the following command from within the RSQKit folder:

``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should now be able to access your local copy of RSQKit on <http://127.0.0.1:4000>.

### Installing RSQKit using a Docker container

**Prerequisites:** `docker` and `docker-compose`.

To install a Docker engine locally, follow the [official installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
Docker Compose is available natively on Docker Desktop, as a Docker Engine plugin, and as a standalone tool - check [Compose installation
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for your setup.

We provide `docker-compose.yml` file for RSQKit container to help you set up.

After successfully setting up `docker` and `docker-compose`, run the following commands.

``` bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You should now be able to access your local copy of RSQKit on <http://127.0.0.1:4000>.
