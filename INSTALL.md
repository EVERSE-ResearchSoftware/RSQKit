# Local Installation

**NOTE: it is not necessary to install and run RSQKit locally to make contributions to it - check our [**Contribution Guidelines**](https://everse.software/RSQKit/contribution_guidelines) for details.**

The [RSQKit website](https://everse.software/RSQKit/) is automatically built and deployed whenever changes are merged into the main branch of this repository. 
For every pull request, a preview version of the resulting site will be generated by [Netlify](https://everse-rsqkit-testing.netlify.app/).
Therefore, it is generally not necessary to install the RSQKit locally and contributions can be made via GitHub interface too.

Nevertheless, if you do wish to run the RSQKit website locally for development and testing purposes, please follow the instructions below. 

## Installing Dependencies

The RSQKit uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the website based on the information located in this repository. 
Jekyll is a Ruby gem which can be installed on most systems. 

To install Ruby, follow the installation instructions on https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/. 
You will also need Bundler (a gem to manage Ruby gems on your system) - but it is usually preinstalled with modern distributions of Ruby. 

To install Jekyll, follow the installation instructions on https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/.

After successfully installing Jekyll, clone the RSQKit repository on your machine (e.g. using SSH): 

```
git clone git@github.com:EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit.git
```

Next, you will need to install the dependencies of the RSQKit itself:

```
cd RSQKit
bundle install
```

## Building the RSQkit

Once the dependencies are successfully installed, you can build and run the RSQKit locally using the following command: 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can now access your local copy of the RSQKit on http://127.0.0.1:4000.
