Research Software Quality Kit (RSQKit), developed as part of [EVERSE project](https://everse.software/), contains a collection of curated training resources, tools and guidelines on research software quality that align, adapt, and extend to the specific needs of various research communities. It also aims to establish a recognition framework that rewards scientists and trainers for their contributions to research software by providing recognition/credit attribution.

> [!WARNING]
> The current version of RSQKit is a work in progress. 
> Any content should not be considered final at this stage.

## Contributing

The RSQKit is currently in a startup phase and still under heavy development which means its structure and content is likely to change a lot. 
During this phase, we mainly organise contributions through the EVERSE project's internal documents and communication channels, although it is possible for people external to the project to contribute. 
We particularly welcome reports on issues and problems with existing pages, fixes to existing content, and reviews of proposed changes.

The content of RSQKit is currently being approved and curated by the [RSQKit Editorial Board](http://everse.software/RSQKit/editorial_board), who are also acting as the official **Maintainers** of the RSQKit repository. 
The RSQKit **Editorial Board Members** work together with general **Contributors** to identify where and how their contribution fits best in RSQKit.

Please see our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to contribute to RSQKit.
