Research Software Quality Kit (RSQKit), developed as part of the [EVERSE project](https://everse.software/), contains curated best practices in improving the quality of research software. It is intended for use by researchers, research software engineers, those managing and procuring funding for projects with a large research software component, those running research infrastructures involving software and those developing research software related policy at organisations and in projects.  

> [!NOTE]
> The content of RSQKit is still work in progress.

## Contributing

The RSQKit is currently in a startup phase and still under heavy development which means its structure and content is likely to change a lot. 
During this phase, we mainly organise contributions through the EVERSE project's internal documents and communication channels, although it is possible for people external to the project to contribute. 
We particularly welcome reports on issues and problems with existing pages, fixes to existing content, and reviews of proposed changes.

The content of RSQKit is currently being approved and curated by the [RSQKit Editorial Board](http://everse.software/RSQKit/editorial_board), who are also acting as the official **Maintainers** of the RSQKit repository. 
The RSQKit **Editorial Board Members** work together with general **Contributors** to identify where and how their contribution fits best in RSQKit.

Please see the [Contribution Guidelines](/pages/contributing/contribution_guidelines.md) for more details on how to contribute to RSQKit or [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) on how to install and run RSQKit locally.
